            <h3>What you need</h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>a deck of cards</li>
                <li>a flat surface to play on</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The objective is to get the highest score possible without going over 21
                <br>
                <br>The numbered cards are worth the points on the card
                <br>
                <br>The royals(Jack,Queen,King) are worth 10
                <br>
                <br>The ace is worth either 1 or 11 points depending on what the player wants</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <p>
                <b id="important">This assumes you are playing at home</b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>the dealing</h4>
            <p>PLayers place their bets before the dealing starts
                <br>
                <br>at the begining of the round the players and dealer are dealt two cards
                <br>
                <br>The player's cards are normally dealt face up
                <br>
                <br>The dealer has one card dealt face-down(this is known as the hole) and one face-up
                <br>
                <br>The best possible inital hand to be dealt is an ace and one card worth 10 points
                <br>
                <br>This is known as blackjack or 'natural 21'
                <br>
                <br>if aplayer gets a blackjack they automatically win unless the dealer also has a blackjack in which case it is a tie
                <br>
                <br>If the dealer has a blackjack any players without a blackjack automatically lose</p>
            <h4>The player's turn</h4>
            <br>
            <p>The player first say if he is going to use any of the side rules(explained later)
                <br>
                <br>Then the player can keep his hand (stand) or take a card from the deck (hit)
                <br>
                <br>The player can hit until he decides to stand or exceeds 21 and loses (goes bust)
                <br>
            </p>
            <h4>The dealer's turn</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Once all the players have finished their actions the dealer turns over his hidden card
                <br>
                <br>If the dealer has a blackjack then all the palyers lose (unless they also have a blckjack)
                <br>
                <br>If the dealer doesn't have a blackjack then they either hit or stand
                <br>
                <br>However the dealer hits and stands based on rules:
                <br>
                <br>if he has less than 17 he must hit and if has more he must stand
                <br>
                <br>When at home change the dealer after every hand to keep it fair or have someone whois the appointed daler the whole night</p>
            <h4>The side rules</h4>
            <h5>Insurance</h5>
            <p>When a dealer's face-up card is an ace the players have the choice to bet on wether the dealer has a blackjack or not
                <br>
                <br>The insurance bet is equivalent to the bet placed and is payed back at odds of 2:1 if the dealer does have a blackjack whilst the origninal bet will be lost.
                <b>so the player basically breaks even</b>
            </p>
            <h5>surrender</h5>
            <p>If the player has a bad hand in comparison to the dealer(based on what they can see) they can give up their hand and reclaim half of their bet</p>
            <h5>Splitting</h5>
            <p>If a player gets two starting cards of the same score then he can split into two hands
                <br>
                <br>the player puts another bet on the new hand that is the same size as the bet on the original hand
                <br>
                <br>the dealer will then deal a second card to each of the new cards
                <br>
                <br>The player then treats the two hands seperately so can go bust or stand and then do the same on the second hand</p>
            <h5>Double down</h5>
            <p>If th player is confident their the hand will beat the dearler's hand you may double your original bet</p>
            <h3>Betting</h3>
            <br>
            <p>At the end of each round one of four things will happen for the player</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lose (where the player's bet is taken by the dealer</li>
                <li>Win(The player wins as much as he bets and keeps his own money,doubling how much they have)</li>
                <li>BlackJack (The player wins 1.5 times their bet and keeps his own money)</li>
                <li>Tie (The player gets back the money they bet)</li>
            </ul>
