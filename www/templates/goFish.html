            <h3>What you need</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>a deck of playing cards</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <p>shuffle the deck</p>
                <br><p>deal out seven cards to each player</p>
                <br><p>place the reaming cards face down</p>
                <br><p>the player to the right of the dealer goes first</p>
                <br><p>The player then asks any other player if they a have any cards of a specific number or rank</p>
                <br><p>(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack,King,Queen)</p>
                <br><p>if the player who is asked has any cards with the rank asked for the must give all of their cards in that rank to the player who asked</p>
                <br><p>If the player who is asked doesn't have any cards with the rank asked for they say "Go Fish"</p>
                <br><p>when the player "Goes Fish" they pick up a card from the pile</p>
                <br><p>if the player was right ,and collected cards form another player, they can then ask again(to the same of different player)</p>
                <br><p>When a player "goes Fish" there turn ends and the next player (going clockwise) has their turn</p>
                <br><p>once a player has all four cards of a rank they place then down to show other that they have the whole rank</p>
                <br><p>this continues until there are no cards left</p>
                <br><p>the winner is whoever has the most ranks</p>
                <br><p>if player have the same amount of ranks then the ranks are used to score and whoever has the highest score wins </p>
                <br><p>the scores work as follows (highest value top left, lowest value bottom right)</p>
