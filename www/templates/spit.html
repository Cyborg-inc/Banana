            <h3>What you need</h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>a deck of cards</li>
                <li>a flat surface to play on</li>
                <li>someone to play against</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <p>Split the deck(s) equally between the player
                <br>
                <br>Place one card face up and four cards face down
                <br>
                <br>place one card face up,on top of the card face down that is adjacent to the card which is face up, and three cards face down
                <br>
                <br>place one card face up,on top of the card face down that is adjacent to the card which is face up, and two cards face down
                <br>
                <br>place one card face up,on top of the card face down that is adjacent to the card which is face up, and one card face down
                <br>
                <br>place one card face up,on top of the card face down that is adjacent to the card which is face up, and place the remaining cards face down in a seperate pile(known as the spit cards)
                <br>
                <br>
                <b id="important">You should have 5 piles of cards increasing from 1 to 5 in increments of 1 with the top card face up and all cards underneath face down(these are your stock piles)</b>
                <br>
                <br>when both players are ready they flip over the first of their spit cards
                <br>
                <br>This creates the spit piles on to whcih player place cards from their stock piles
                <br>
                <br>the players put their stock cards onto the spit piles if the the stock card has a value that is on above or one below that of the spit card
                <br>
                <br>the image below explains the concept (you can go either way arounf the circle</p>
            <center>

            </center>
            <p>if the player has a card face down then they can turn it face up and play it (if possible)
                <br>
                <br>If the player finshes one of their stock piles they can move the face up card off one of their other piles to create a new pile
                <br>
                <br>when one player gets rid of all their stock cards all players can hit one of the piles to claim the cards in that spit piles
                <b id="important">the player should go for the smaller pile</b>
                <br>
                <br>The players then take any remaining stock cards, their spit cards and the recently picked up spit piles and shuffle then
                <br>
                <br>then repeat until someone runs out of cards
                <b>
                    <br>
                    <br>this can happen as eventually a player will have no cards to use for a spit card pile.
                    <br>
                    <br>When this happens there will be a pile of no cards that a player can hit at the end of the round</b>

            <h3>playing with more than two people</h3>
            <p>when playing with more than two people the only things that change are</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of spit piles</li>
                <li>The number of spit card piles</li>
                <li>The number of decks used</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>add an extra deck for every odd number of players (so 2 for 3, 3 for 5, 4 for 7 ,etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
