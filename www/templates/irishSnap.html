            <h3>What you need</h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>a deck of cards</li>
                <li>a flat surface to play on</li>
                <li>people play against</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <p>Split the deck evenly amongst the players with the cards face down</p>
                <br><p>Choose a player to go first</p>
                <br><p>They will place a card face up in the middle and say 'one'</p>
                <br><p>Then the next player will then place down acard face up a say 'two</p>
                <br><p>This continues up to thirteen then the next player will place a card face up and say 'one'</p>
                <br><p>this is repeated again and again</p>
                <br><p>If when a card is put down it has the same value as the number said (Jack=11 Queen=12 King=13 Ace=1)Then all players must put their hands on the pile in the middle</p>
                <br><p>The last player to put their hand in the middle must pick up the pile</p>
                <br><p>this also happens if the two card placed in the middle has the same value as the card before it</p>
                <br><p>whoever picked up the cards starts the next round</p>
                <br><p>if a player says the wrong number or hits the pile when their isn't a snap has to pick up the center pile</p>
                <br><p>When a player is out of cards they simply say the correct number when it becomes their turn without placing a card</p>
                <br><p>The loser is the last person to still have cards</p>
