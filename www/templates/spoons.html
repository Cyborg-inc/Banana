            <h3>What you need</h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>a deck of cards</li>
                <li>a flat surface to play on</li>
                <li>3 to 13 players</li>
                <li>One fewer than the number of players)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <p>Place the spoons in a circle in the middle of the table
                <br>
                <br>From the deck get all four cards of the required ranks (You need a rank for each player)
                <br>Then deal out these cards so there are four for each player
                <br>
                <br>The players try to get four cards of the same rank
                <br>
                <br>They do this by sliding one of their cards to the player to their right and taking the card given to them by the player to their left
                <br>
                <br>Once a player has all four cards of a rank then they can take a spoon from the center
                <br>
                <br>Once one player has taken a spoon all players can take a spoon (regardless of the cards they have)
                <br>
                <br>One person won't be able to get a spoon and they will be given a letter
                <br>
                <br>Then the cards are reshuffled and the next round starts
                <br>
                <br>A player is out when they have spelt out S-P-O-O-N
                <br>
                <br>The las player to be out wins
            </p>
