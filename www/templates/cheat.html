            <h3>What you need</h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>a deck of cards</li>
                <li>a flat surface to play on</li>
                <li>at least three players</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <p>Split the deck equally between the players</p>
                <br><p>if there a remaining cards place them face down to start the discard pile</p>
                <br><p>The player to the left of the dealer starts</p>
                <br><p>The player puts down somecards of the same rank (or just one of that rank) and says the number of cards of that rank he has placed down</p>
                <br><p>the next player then places down cards one rank above or below the previous player's rank</p>
                <br><p>If the player has no cards of that rank they can lie and place down cards claiming them to be of that rank</p>
                <br><p>this is repeated with the next player and so on</p>
                <br><p>If a player believes that another is playing they can call out "cheat"</p>
                <br><p>when someone calls cheat the person who is challenged must turn the cards they just played face up</p>
                <br><p>if the challenged player was lying then he must pick up all the cards in the discard pile</p>
                <br><p>however if the challanged player was telling the truth the challenger must pick up the cards</p>
                <br><p>The winner is the first person to get rid of all their cards</p>
