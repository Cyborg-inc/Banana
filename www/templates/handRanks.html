            <h5>Royal Flush</h5>
            <p>A Royal flush is an Ace-high straight flush
                <br>so an Ace-King-Queen-Jack-10 of the same suit</p>
            <h5>Straight Flush</h5>
            <p>A straight flush is a five-card stright of the same suit
                <br>So a 7-6-5-4-3 all of diamonds</p>
            <h5>Four of a Kind</h5>
            <p>Four of a Kind is four cards of equal value like 4 Jacks</p>
            <h5>Full House</h5>
            <p>A full house has a set of 3 of cards of one value and a pair of cards of another value
                <br>For example, three queens and a pair of twos</p>
            <h5>Flush</h5>
            <p>A flush is five cards of the same suit which can't be put in sequence</p>
            <h5>Straight</h5>
            <p>Five cards of sequnetial value made of multiple suits
                <br>for example, 7-6-5-4-3
                <br>intresting fact: all straights will contain a 5 or a 10</p>
            <h5>Three of a Kind</h5>
            <p>three of a kind is three cards of the same value, like three aces</p>
            <h5>two pairs</h5>
            <p>This is two cards of one and value and two cards of another value
                <br>For example, two jacks and two 8s</p>
            <h5>A Pair</h5>
            <p>one pair of cards of the same value like two queens</p>
            <h5>High Card</h5>
            <p>If none of the players have any of the above the palyer with the card of the highest value wins</p>

            <h3>In the event of a tie</h3>
            <p>In the event of a tie where not all 5 cards are used in the hand then the side cards(cards not being used) or "kickers" to decide the winner
                <br>The winner when using side cards is whoever has the highest valued card as their "kicker"
                <br>For example, if two players had and indentical hand of two tens and two fives but one player had a six and the other player had a four then the player with the six would win
                <br>If the players have and equal first kicker then a second,third or fourth kicker may come into play (it depends on what hand their is a tie on
                <br>if the when all the kickers are used then the pot is split between the players evenly</p>
